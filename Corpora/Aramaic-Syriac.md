[Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon] (http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/) includes texts from Aramaic of all dialects and periods. Browse texts by clicking on "Text Browse" (http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/text_browse.html). The website uses frames, so URLs do not appear in the address bar and if you go directly to URLs you lose the navigation bar. Texts are lemmatized, but data files are not clearly exposed and the license is not clearly labeled.
